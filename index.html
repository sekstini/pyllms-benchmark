      <td>To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0, we can use factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square. The simplest method here is factoring because the equation is already in a form that suggests it might factor nicely.\n\nWe are looking for two numbers that multiply to give the constant term (6) and add up to give the coefficient of the x term (-5).\n\nThe factors of 6 that add up to -5 are -2 and -3. So we can write the quadratic equation as:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nNow, we use the zero product property, which states that if a product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx - 2 = 0  or  x - 3 = 0\n\nSolving each equation for x gives us:\n\nx = 2  or  x = 3\n\nSo the solutions to the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 are x = 2 and x = 3.</td>

      <td>To find the largest and third largest integer in a list, you can sort the list in descending order and then pick the first and third elements. However, this approach is not the most efficient if the list is very large, as sorting can take O(n log n) time.\n\nA more efficient approach would be to iterate through the list once and keep track of the largest and third largest numbers. This can be done in O(n) time. Here's a Python function that does this:\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_and_third_largest(lst):\n    if len(lst) &lt; 3:\n        raise ValueError("List must contain at least three elements.")\n\n    # Initialize the largest, second largest, and third largest\n    largest = second_largest = third_largest = float('-inf')\n\n    for num in lst:\n        # Update the largest, second largest, and third largest if necessary\n        if num &gt; largest:\n            third_largest = second_largest\n            second_largest = largest\n            largest = num\n        elif largest &gt; num &gt; second_largest:\n            third_largest = second_largest\n            second_largest = num\n        elif second_largest &gt; num &gt; third_largest:\n            third_largest = num\n\n    return largest, third_largest\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [5, 1, 5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 6, 7]\nlargest, third_largest = find_largest_and_third_largest(numbers)\nprint(f"Largest: {largest}, Third Largest: {third_largest}")\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list has at least three elements, as it's not possible to find the third largest element in a list with fewer than three elements. It then initializes three variables to keep track of the largest, second largest, and third largest numbers seen so far.\n\nAs it iterates through the list, it updates these variables accordingly. If the current number is greater than the largest, it shifts the current largest to second largest and the second largest to third largest, and then updates the largest. If the current number is between the largest and second largest, it updates the second and third largest. If the current number is between the second largest and third largest, it updates the third largest.\n\nThis ensures that by the end of the iteration, the function has correctly identified the largest and third largest numbers in the list.</td>

      <td>To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which one worker can paint the fence and then adjust that rate to account for the breaks.\n\nFirst, let's find out how long it would take one worker to paint the fence without any breaks. If two workers can paint the fence in 8 hours, then together they have a combined rate of 1 fence per 8 hours (1/8 fence/hour). Since they are working together at the same rate, we can assume each worker contributes half of the work. Therefore, one worker would paint the fence at a rate of 1/16 fence/hour (since 1/8 divided by 2 equals 1/16).\n\nNow, let's calculate how long it would take one worker to paint the fence without breaks. Since the worker's rate is 1/16 fence/hour, it would take them 16 hours to paint the entire fence (since 1 divided by 1/16 equals 16).\n\nHowever, the worker needs to take a 30-minute break after every hour of work. This means that for every hour of work, the worker actually works for only 1 hour and then takes a 30-minute break, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours of time passing.\n\nTo find out how many breaks the worker will take, we can divide the total work time (16 hours) by the duration of each work session (1 hour of work before a break). This gives us 16 breaks. However, since the worker does not need to take a break after the last hour of work, we subtract one break from this total, resulting in 15 breaks.\n\nEach break is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), so the total break time is 15 breaks * 0.5 hours/break = 7.5 hours.\n\nNow, we add the total break time to the total work time to find out how long it will take the injured worker to paint the fence:\n\nTotal time = Work time + Break time\nTotal time = 16 hours (work time) + 7.5 hours (break time)\nTotal time = 23.5 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take the injured worker 23.5 hours to paint the fence, including the breaks.</td>

Calculate the sum:\n   - Ones place: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25 (write down 5, carry over 2)\n   - Tens place: 20 (from the four 5's) + 2 (carried over) = 22 (write down 2, carry over 2)\n   - Hundreds place: 20 (from the four 5's) + 2 (carried over) = 22 (write down 2, carry over 2)\n   - Thousands place: 20 (from the four 5's) + 2 (carried over) = 22 (write down 2, carry over 2)\n   - Ten-thousands place: 5 (from the fifth number) + 2 (carried over) = 7\n\n5. Write down the sum of the numbers: 72225\n\n6. Now subtract 1725 from this sum:\n   72225\n- 1725\n________\n   70500\n\nThe final answer is 70500.</td>

      <td>Let's denote the three numbers as A, B, and C. According to the problem:\n\n1. A + B + C = 96 (the sum of the three numbers is 96)\n2. A = 6C (the first number is 6 times the third number)\n3. C = B - 40 (the third number is 40 less than the second number)\n\nWe can use these equations to solve for the numbers. First, let's express A and C in terms of B using equations 2 and 3:\n\nA = 6C\nC = B - 40\n\nNow we can substitute A and C in the first equation with their expressions in terms of B:\n\nA + B + C = 96\n6C + B + C = 96\nB - 40 + B + B - 40 = 96 (substituting C = B - 40 into the equation)\n3B - 80 = 96\n3B = 96 + 80\n3B = 176\nB = 176 / 3\nB = 58.666... (approximately)\n\nNow that we have B, we can find C:\n\nC = B - 40\nC = 58.666... - 40\nC = 18.666... (approximately)\n\nAnd then we can find A:\n\nA = 6C\nA = 6 * 18.666...\nA = 112 (approximately, since 6 * 18.666... is actually 112)\n\nNow we have approximate values for A, B, and C. However, we made a rounding error in the process. Since we are dealing with whole numbers, let's correct this by not rounding:\n\nB = 176 / 3\nB = 58 + 2/3\n\nNow let's find C exactly:\n\nC = B - 40\nC = (58 + 2/3) - 40\nC = 18 + 2/3\n\nAnd then A:\n\nA = 6C\nA = 6 * (18 + 2/3)\nA = 6 * 18 + 6 * (2/3)\nA = 108 + 4\nA = 112\n\nNow we have the exact values for A, B, and C:\n\nA = 112\nB = 58 + 2/3\nC = 18 + 2/3\n\nThe absolute value of the difference between the first and second numbers is:\n\n|A - B| = |112 - (58 + 2/3)|\n|A - B| = |112 - 58 - 2/3|\n|A - B| = |54 - 2/3|\n|A - B| = |(162/3) - (2/3)|\n|A - B| = |(162 - 2)/3|\n|A - B| = |160/3|\n|A - B| = 53 + 1/3\n\nSo the absolute value of the difference between the first and second numbers is 53 + 1/3.</td>

      <td>Let's solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, we are given that the least common multiple (LCM) of a positive integer n and 18 is 180. The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3^2. The prime factorization of 180 is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5. For 180 to be the LCM of n and 18, n must include the prime factors of 18, and it must have the additional prime factor of 5 to reach 180. Since the LCM already includes the maximum powers of 2 and 3 from 18, n must be a multiple of 5, but it cannot include any additional powers of 2 or 3 beyond what is already present in 18, otherwise, the LCM would be greater than 180.\n\nNext, we are given that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and 45 is 15. The prime factorization of 45 is 3^2 * 5. The GCD of n and 45 being 15 means that n shares the prime factors 3 and 5 with 45, but not the additional factor of 3 that would make the GCD 45. Since the GCD is 15, the prime factorization of n must include 3 and 5, but not an additional 3.\n\nCombining the information from the LCM and GCD, we can deduce that n must include at least one factor of 2 (from the LCM with 18), at least one factor of 3, and at least one factor of 5 (from the GCD with 45). However, since the LCM with 18 is 180, n cannot have more than two factors of 2 and cannot have more than two factors of 3, as that would increase the LCM beyond 180.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of n must be 2 * 3 * 5 * k, where k is a factor that does not include the primes 2 or 3, otherwise, it would violate the conditions for the LCM and GCD.\n\nSince the LCM of n and 18 is 180, and we already have 2 * 3^2 as part of 18, the only missing prime factor from 180 is 5. Therefore, k must be 5 to complete the LCM to 180.\n\nSo, n = 2 * 3 * 5 * 5 = 2 * 3 * 25 = 6 * 25 = 150.\n\nThe sum of the digits of n (which is 150) is 1 + 5 + 0 = 6.</td>

      <td>Capture the essence of this in exactly 7 words: "There’s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we’re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us ‘us,’ we’ve got a lot to say. While you don’t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where ‘foundered’ sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more ‘clinker’ than ‘beezer’? Or appreciating that ‘grand’ can mean exactly that or anything but? If the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.“I think it’s really important,” says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language."</td>

It first checks if `nums` is empty, and if so, it returns 0. Then it creates a list `dp` of the same length as `nums`, where each element is 1. This list will be used to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index of `nums`.\n\nThe function then iterates over `nums` twice, with the outer loop variable `i` ranging from 0 to the length of `nums`, and the inner loop variable `j` ranging from 0 to `i`. For each pair of indices `(i, j)`, if `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This is because if `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[j]`, then `nums[i]` can be appended to the increasing subsequence ending at `j`, resulting in an increasing subsequence of length `dp[j] + 1`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the maximum value in `dp`, which is the length of the longest increasing subsequence in `nums`.</td>
